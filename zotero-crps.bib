Teams of black and white men were matched and sent to apply for low-wage jobs throughout the city, presenting equivalent resumes and differing only in their race and criminal background. The authors find a significant negative effect of a criminal record on employment outcomes that appears substantially larger for African Americans. The sequence of interactions preceding hiring decisions suggests that black applicants are less often invited to interview, thereby providing fewer opportunities to establish rapport with the employer. Furthermore, employers' general reluctance to discuss the criminal record of an applicant appears especially harmful for black ex-offenders. Overall, these results point to the importance of rapport-building for finding work, something that the stigmatizing characteristics of minority and criminal status make more difficult to achieve.]},

	abstract = {Problem

Low-skilled workers, particularly those with criminal records, have been most adversely affected by labor market changes in the last few decades.  Many policymakers recognize the urgency of increasing opportunity for these workers. However, recent legislative initiatives aimed at doing so have produced mixed results. 
 
Proposal

To better help individuals with criminal records successfully navigate the low-skill labor market, the author offers five guiding principles for policymakers. These are: (1) increase availability of jobs for low-skill workers, through effective jobs programs, licensing reform, and tighter labor markets; (2) focus on building work readiness, by providing wrap-around services and effective job-training programs; (3) communicate work readiness to employers, by issuing high-quality certification for completion of training programs and apprenticeships; (4) reduce the cost of hiring people with criminal records; and (5) weigh the impact of employer regulations that might have unintended consequences.
Abstract

Workers with criminal records, in particular black and Hispanic males with criminal records, face many labor market challenges—over and above the challenges faced by the larger population of low-skilled workers. Finding ways to improve employment outcomes for individuals with criminal records is an urgent priority with implications for public safety, the economy, and families of those with records. 

New evidence documenting unintended negative consequences of one recent attempt to address this concern—Ban the Box laws that delay employer access to information about applicants—should be considered as the policy discussion moves forward. As policymakers continue efforts to address employment among workers with criminal records, it is imperative that they begin with an understanding of how employers interact with job applicants who have criminal records. Accordingly, a multi-pronged approach—inclusive of effective policies aimed at building workers’ skills, communicating their work-readiness to employers, and promoting robust labor markets for low-skilled workers—is necessary for improving employment outcomes for workers with criminal records.},

	abstract = {Jurisdictions across the United States have adopted "ban the box" (BTB) policies preventing employers from conducting criminal background checks until late in the job application process. Their goal is to improve employment outcomes for those with criminal records, with a secondary goal of reducing racial disparities in employment. However, removing information about job applicants' criminal histories could lead employers who don't want to hire ex-offenders to try to guess who the ex-offenders are, and avoid interviewing them. In particular, employers might avoid interviewing young, low-skilled, black and Hispanic men when criminal records are not observable. This would worsen employment outcomes for these already-disadvantaged groups. In this paper, we use variation in the details and timing of state and local BTB policies to test BTB's effects on employment for various demographic groups. We find that BTB policies decrease the probability of being employed by 3.4 percentage points (5.1\%) for young, low-skilled black men, and by 2.3 percentage points (2.9\%) for young, low-skilled Hispanic men. These findings support the hypothesis that when an applicant's criminal history is unavailable, employers statistically discriminate against demographic groups that are likely to have a criminal record.},
